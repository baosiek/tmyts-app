    <h1>On-Balance Volume (OBV) Indicator</h1>

    <p>The <strong>On-Balance Volume (OBV)</strong> indicator is a technical analysis tool used to measure the cumulative buying and selling pressure in a financial market. It is particularly popular among traders and analysts for identifying potential price movements based on volume changes.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of OBV</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Volume-Based</strong>: OBV uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. The idea is that volume precedes price movement; thus, if a stock is seeing an increase in volume without a corresponding price increase, it may indicate that the stock is being accumulated.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Calculation</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>If the closing price of the current period is <strong>higher</strong> than the previous period, the OBV increases by the volume of the current period.</li>
                <li>If the closing price is <strong>lower</strong>, the OBV decreases by the volume of the current period.</li>
                <li>If the closing price is <strong>unchanged</strong>, the OBV remains the same.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formula can be summarized as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OBV = Previous OBV + Current Volume</strong> (if the price closes higher)</li>
                <li><strong>OBV = Previous OBV - Current Volume</strong> (if the price closes lower)</li>
                <li><strong>OBV = Previous OBV</strong> (if the price closes unchanged)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bullish Signals</strong>: An increasing OBV suggests that buying pressure is increasing, which might indicate that the price is likely to rise in the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Bearish Signals</strong>: A decreasing OBV indicates increasing selling pressure, suggesting that the price may fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Divergence</strong>: If the OBV is moving in the opposite direction of the price, it may signal a potential reversal. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>If the price is rising while OBV is falling, it may indicate a weakening trend and a potential price correction.</li>
                <li>Conversely, if the price is falling while OBV is rising, it could indicate accumulation and a potential price reversal to the upside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Volume Manipulation</strong>: In low-volume stocks, OBV can be misleading, as small trades can significantly affect the indicator.</li>
        <li><strong>Lagging Indicator</strong>: Like many technical indicators, OBV is a lagging indicator, which means it may not predict price movements in real-time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The OBV indicator is a useful tool for traders looking to understand the relationship between volume and price movement. It can help identify trends and potential reversals, but itâ€™s best used in conjunction with other indicators and analysis techniques to confirm signals and make informed trading decisions.</p>
